This is the basic web component library for BYU. It's meant to provide examples along with the HTML (mustache) templates, styles, scripts, and other assets necessary to render them. It's currently a work in progress.

Use the navigation at the left to view the current components. Note the labels indicating that they're either ready or still in progress.

### Other References:
BYU currently uses a system of web components to deliver a consistent header and footer to all of campus. The specifications here duplicate or extend those components, and should be used for plain HTML rendering.
