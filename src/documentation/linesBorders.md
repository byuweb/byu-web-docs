For component borders like panels and tiles, use Grey 5 (#E0E2E2)
For rule lines, including those in tables, use Grey 15 (#BDC0C0)

A 1px solid "Lightest Grey" border is applied to panels, drop-downs, modals, cards, etc. This subtle border helps to define the edges of these interface elements.Â 

A 1px solid grey 15 border is used for rule lines and table borders.

Field inputs have a 1px solid grey 20 border.
